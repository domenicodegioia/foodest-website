# Foodest Website üç¥

This project is a simple showcase website created for a fictional restaurant.
It demonstrates the structure and functionality of a typical restaurant website, including a homepage, gallery, contact page, and a dynamic PHP-driven menu page.
The project was designed as a practical web development example or portfolio piece.


## Repository structure

The main structure of the project includes:
* `index.html` ‚Äì the homepage
* `galleria.html` ‚Äì the photo gallery
* `contact.html `‚Äì the contact page
* `menu.php` ‚Äì the restaurant menu page, managed dynamically through PHP
* `style/` ‚Äì folder containing CSS files
* `js/` ‚Äì folder containing JavaScript scripts
* `images/` ‚Äì folder containing images used throughout the website
* `db/` ‚Äì folder that may contain SQL scripts or database structures

The project mixes static HTML pages with a dynamic PHP component for the menu.


## Technologies and languages 
* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS
* Backend: PHP for dynamic content
* Database: MySQL (the db folder suggests some SQL-related functionality)
* Web server: Apache, configured through XAMPP


## Current features

* Static homepage, gallery, and contact pages
* Dynamic PHP page for the restaurant menu
